Welcome to schedule weekly.  
The JSON file used to store the schedules is called "schedule_weekly.json",
it uses days abbreviations (Mon - Sun), and also has one unique day called 'Daily'.  
It is meant to be a CLI scheduler.  
Do not change the JSON file as I didn't implement first time initialization.

Some commands example:

**'add today morning'** -> add schedules on whatever day is today at morning. A loop prompt will exist  
**'delete today morning'** -> delete schedule using their index or value or delete all schedule.  
**'see wed'** -> see schedule on Wednesday
